<h2>Time Paradox란 어떤 영화인가?</h2>
  <p>The movie(<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 spicefication">Time Paradox</a>) is called <strong>'Time <u>Paradox</u>'</strong>.

  Just one thing I know is that it is thrill and has a big reverse moment.
  So I am literally lookig forward to it.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">A temporal paradox, time paradox, or time travel paradox is a paradox, an apparent contradiction, or logical contradiction associated with the idea of time and time travel.</p><p> In physics, temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups: consistency paradoxes exemplified by the grandfather paradox; and causal loops.[1] Other paradoxes associated with time travel are a variation of the Fermi paradox and paradoxes of free will that stem from causal loops such as Newcomb's paradox.
